Just lauch the Mathematica notebooks to obtain the plots for ws (i) (steady state optimization)

"plot-opt-lower.nb" generate the plots of "Lower bound target"

"plot-opt-target.nb" generate the plots of "Optimal target"

The programs generate also the .txt file contaning AUC, concetration of Imatinib in blood and  the euclidean cumulative distance 
for every case.

Parameters of the patients in the dataset are in the file "personal-parameters.txt", please refer to "legend-personal-parameters"
if you want to read the file
