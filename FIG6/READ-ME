Just lauch the Mathematica notebook "TB-dosi-auc-conc-patients.nb" to obtain FIg. 6 for every patient.
If you change which doses you import, in the notebook, you could obtain results for different values of \phi
The data files are named in the following way "doses-Add-TB-wXX.txt", where A=1,or 3 indicates the number of doses per day 
and XX indicates the value of \phi
