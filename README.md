# CT4TD
Control Theory for Therapy Design
----------------------------------

The increasing availability of experimental data on cancer patients and the growth of computing power are paving the way for an effective application of control theory to precision medicine.

We introduce the CT4TD (Control Theory for Therapy Design) theoretical framework, which combines optimal control theory and population dynamics to deliver patient-specific therapeutic strategies, by translating the physiological features of individuals into personalized pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics models. 

With CT4TD it is possible to identify optimized therapies at diagnosis, aimed at reaching selected drug concentration, or to adjust existing therapeutic regimes, when longitudinal data on disease progression are available.  

A preprint of the article is available at this link: 

This repositories contains script and data to reproduced the case study discussed in the article. 
In particular, we apply CT4TD to the case of Imatinib administration in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and show that tailored therapies display remarkable advantages in terms of efficacy and reduced toxicity.
